Although the meme may be making a judgment about the individual in the image, it does not attack anyone based on characteristics such as ethnicity, race, nationality, immigration status, religion, caste, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, or disease. It does not contain any violent or dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, or calls for exclusion or segregation.
